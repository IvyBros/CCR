        Every dog here is a family member and gets treated
        with love and respect.  Our dogs are happy and healthy and enjoy the fresh country air.  They get plenty
        of excericse every day chasing frisbees, squirrels and the occasional loose chicken.  Along with regular veterinary 
        checkups and closely monitored diets, a steady dose of geniuene affection keeps our dogs looking and feeling great.
        All our puppies are vaccinated at age appropriate times and they stay with their mother until at least 10 weeks of age.

        Our first and foremost concern is the health and safety of our animals.  We won't let our pups go to the home of anyone 
        we haven't met or spoken to personally.  We realize this may cause you some inconvenience and we apologize.  We also 
        understand completely that we may miss out on a sale because of this policy, and we're fine with that.
