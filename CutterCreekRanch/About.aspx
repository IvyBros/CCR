    <p>
        At Cutter Creek Ranch, every dog here is a family member and gets treated
        with love and respect.  Our dogs are happy and healthy and enjoy the fresh country air.  They get plenty
        of excericse every day chasing frisbees, squirrels and the occasional loose chicken.  Along with regular veterinary 
        checkups and closely monitored diets, a steady dose of geniuene affection keeps our dogs looking and feeling great.
        All our puppies are vaccinated at age appropriate times and they stay with their mother until at least 10 weeks of age.

        The border collie breed is intelligent and has a strong appetite for learning.  These delightful dogs are 
        instantly ready and willing to take on any task with eagerness and a strong desire to please.  
        They are faithful, loyal companions, bred for obedience and discipline. With their instinctive herding ability
        and tireless work ethic, the Border Collie is the best and hardest working breed of all herding dogs.
